# Sparta Remix Scripts

A collection of functions within a script which allows Sparta Remixers/YTPMVers to fasten their workflow.

Users can flip even events, fill all events, and even execute basic keyframing.
Examples of such keyframing include:
1. Zooming In
2. Zooming Out (Sharp)
3. Zooming Out (Smooth)

To-Do List:
  - GUI Improvements.
  - More Organized Codebase.
  - Customizable settings (e.g. Keyframe types, Scale Factor and Smoothness Factor)
  - This list will have more items soon.

The script works great on Vegas 14 and higher, and that was what the script was primarily tested on.
I have been able to get it working on versions as low as Vegas 8 and 9, but compatibility lower than those versions cannot be guaranteed
and as a result, any issues on getting the script to work on those outdated versions will simply be closed if opened.

Have fun!!!
